   - Save configuration

### Getting API Keys

#### Gmail Access Token
1. Go to [Google OAuth Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground)
2. Select Gmail API v1 â†’ https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify
3. Authorize and get access token
4. **Note**: This is temporary (~1 hour). For production, implement proper OAuth flow.

#### Gemini API Key
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. **Important**: Use your personal key for structured JSON responses

#### Monday.com API Token
1. Go to your Monday.com account â†’ Admin â†’ API
2. Generate a new API token with appropriate permissions

## Usage Guide

### Email Triage Workflow
1. **Fetch Emails**: Click "Fetch Emails" to load from Gmail
2. **Triage Individual Emails**: Click "Triage" to analyze with AI
3. **Review Suggestions**: Check categorization and suggested actions
4. **Execute Actions**: Use quick action buttons or Monday.com integration
5. **Provide Feedback**: Mark as "Correct" or provide corrections
6. **Improve Logic**: Edit triage logic or let feedback train the AI

### Monday.com Integration
1. **Manual Actions**: Create items with specific board ID and name
2. **AI Actions**: Describe what you want in natural language
3. **Investigation**: Use "Investigate Only" to preview AI decisions
4. **Execution**: Use "Process & Execute" to perform actions

#### Example AI Prompts
```
Create a new task called 'Review Q3 Report' on board 'Project Management'

Change the status of 'Website Redesign' on 'Marketing Initiatives' to 'Done'

Update the 'Action' for 'George from Alphabak' working at 'Alphabak' on board 'Activities' to 'Intro email sent'
```

### Using New Developer Features

#### LLM Communication Log
1. **Expand the Log**: Click "Expand" on the "LLM Communication" panel
2. **Monitor AI Calls**: Watch real-time AI requests and responses
3. **Debug Issues**: See exactly what prompts are sent and responses received
4. **Clear History**: Use "Clear" to reset the log

#### Prompt Editor
1. **Expand Editor**: Click "Expand" on the "Core Prompts" panel
2. **Edit Prompts**: Click the edit icon next to any prompt
3. **Test Changes**: New prompts take effect immediately
4. **Reset Defaults**: Use the refresh icon to restore default prompts

#### Token Refresh
1. **Gmail Token**: Click "Refresh" next to Gmail token field
2. **Opens OAuth Playground**: Automatically opens Google's OAuth playground
3. **Get New Token**: Follow the standard OAuth flow
4. **Paste Back**: Copy the new token into the field
